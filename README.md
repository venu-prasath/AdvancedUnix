## Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (CS631)
This is a repository to learn more about UNIX systems and programming in the UNIX Environment. Although, I did not take this course in my university, I was very interested in the syllabus. The course materials are publicly available in the Internet. So, I decided to learn this during my extra hours. I will update my progress in this repository and keep track of important information I come across during this study.

The link to the course materials:
